Github repo: https://github.com/biot-med/terraform-provider-biot-gen2

## Prerequisites

1. GoReleaser installed

2. GPG key configured

3. Youâ€™re a member of the GitHub org: biot-med

4. Fine-grained GitHub token approved by the org admin

4. run in terminal - export GITHUB_TOKEN=<github-token>

5. run in terminal - goreleaser release --clean

This will:

Build binaries for all OS/arch combinations

Package them in .zip files

Generate SHA256SUMS and SHA256SUMS.sig

Create a GitHub release

Upload all files to the release


## Verify GitHub Release

Go to:
ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/biot-med/terraform-provider-biot-gen2/releases

Check that the release:

Has all the .zip artifacts

Has SHA256SUMS and SHA256SUMS.sig

## (First Time Only) Publish to Terraform Registry

If this is the first release, go to:
ðŸ‘‰ https://registry.terraform.io/

Steps:

Click "Publish" â†’ "Provider"

Select GitHub org: biot-med

Select repo: terraform-provider-biot-gen2

Upload your GPG public key (below howto)

Confirm release version detection

Terraform will verify your release, signature, and checksums.

## How to Export Your GPG Public Key

1. gpg --full-generate-key
- Choose (1) RSA and RSA (default)
- Choose 4096 (for strong security)
- Choose as you like, or no expiration
- Enter name and email (use devsecop email)
- Choose a secure passphrase

** Make sure to save details in a confluence page.

2. gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG

3. Look for the line starting with sec, example: 
sec   rsa4096/ABCDEF1234567890 2024-01-01 [SC]

    ABCDEF1234567890 is your GPG KEY ID in this exaimple..

4. Export your GPG public key - gpg --armor --export ABCDEF1234567890 > public.key

This creates a file public.key containing your public GPG key in ASCII format.

5. Upload the public.key file

    Upload this key to wherever itâ€™s needed, e.g.,

    - Terraform Registry provider settings

    - GitHub account (optional)

    - Share with collaborators


Thatâ€™s it â€” now youâ€™re set to sign your releases!
